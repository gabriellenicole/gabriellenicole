## 🌟 About Me  
I'm a software developer with a strong technical background, but my interests extend beyond just writing code. I enjoy understanding people’s perspectives, empathizing with them, and designing solutions that truly make an impact. 

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me ☕ **cafe hopping in search of the perfect brew**, 🇪🇸 **practicing Spanish one phrase at a time**, or 🧠 **diving into deep discussions about human behavior and what drives people’s actions**.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
🔹 **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL  
🔹 **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Firebase, Supabase  
🔹 **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, CircleCI, Azure  
🔹 **Frontend & UI**: React, TailwindCSS, Next.js

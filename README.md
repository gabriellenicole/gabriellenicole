Hi there! 👋 I'm Gaby 

## 🌟 About Me  
I'm a software developer with a strong technical background, but my interests extend beyond just writing code. I enjoy understanding people’s perspectives, empathizing with them, and designing solutions that truly make an impact. My work spans various domains, including:
- 📊 **Healthcare Data Analytics** – Visualizing ICD-10 codes and their relationship to healthcare costs.
- 🏦 **Invoice Processing & Claims Automation** – Extracting structured data from invoices and medical claims.
- 🔍 **Handwriting Recognition & ML** – Evaluating legibility to improve model accuracy.
- 🔄 **CI/CD & DevOps** – Automating workflows and optimizing pipelines.

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me ☕ **cafe hopping in search of the perfect brew**, 🇪🇸 **practicing Spanish one phrase at a time**, or 🧠 **diving into deep discussions about human behavior and what drives people’s actions**.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
🔹 **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL  
🔹 **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Firebase, Supabase  
🔹 **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, CircleCI, Azure  
🔹 **Frontend & UI**: React, TailwindCSS, Next.js
